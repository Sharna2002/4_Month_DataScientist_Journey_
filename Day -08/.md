. The linear scan ->
      The while loop is running though the N number. Time complexity is O(N)<br><br>
. Hash lookup -> <br><br>
. The Insertion Trap -> In list.insert(0,x) n elements need to shift n position so the time complexity is O(N).It executes slower
    In list.append(x)  its free up to the next empty slot. It's doesn't requiere any shifting. 
    Time complexity is O(1). It executes faster. <br><br>
. The Queue bottlenck -> list.pop() follows the stack(last in first out). This function removes the last element of 
    the list without shifting any element. Which complexity is O(1). Faster execution.
    list.pop(0) follows the queue(first in first out). This function removes the first element of 
    the list though shifting the next elements in the previous position. Which complexity is O(N). 
    Slower execution.<br><br>
. The string builder ->  Allocating a new memory and add a char using "".join(new_memory). Time complexity O(n2) <br><br>
. The length trick -> <br><br>
. The Quadratic Nested loop -> Time complexity O(n2)<br><br>
. The sorting cost -> Sorted a random list using merge sort. Time complexity O(NlogN).<br><br>
. The dictionary creator -> Searching contains O(1) but create a dictionary time complexity is O(N).<br><br>
. The sclice copy -> Slicing a list <br><br>
